# 🛡️ DevSecOps Pipeline for Shopping Website Microservices

This document outlines the comprehensive DevSecOps pipeline implemented for the Node.js microservice-based shopping website. The pipeline integrates security, automation, and deployment practices to ensure secure, reliable, and maintainable infrastructure.

## 🎯 Overview

The DevSecOps pipeline consists of four main phases:

1. **Security Scanning (CI)** - Automated security checks
2. **CI/CD Deployment** - Automated build and deployment
3. **Runtime Security** - Kubernetes security best practices
4. **Infrastructure as Code** - Terraform-based infrastructure management

## 🧩 PHASE 1 — SECURITY SCANNING (CI)

### GitHub Actions Workflow: `.github/workflows/devsecops.yaml`

The pipeline includes comprehensive security scanning:

#### Code Quality & Security Analysis
- **CodeQL Analysis**: GitHub's semantic code analysis engine
  - Detects security vulnerabilities in JavaScript/Node.js code
  - Identifies potential security issues and code quality problems
  - Provides detailed reports in GitHub Security tab

#### Dependency Vulnerability Scanning
- **npm audit**: Scans all Node.js dependencies for known vulnerabilities
  - Runs on all microservices (API Gateway, User Service, Order Service, Inventory Service, Notification Service, Frontend)
  - Fails build if high-severity vulnerabilities are found
  - Provides detailed vulnerability reports

#### Container Image Security Scanning
- **Trivy Scanner**: Comprehensive container vulnerability scanning
  - Scans all Docker images for known CVEs
  - Checks for security misconfigurations
  - Generates SARIF reports for GitHub Security tab
  - Covers base image vulnerabilities and application dependencies

### Security Features:
- ✅ Automated security scanning on every push/PR
- ✅ High-severity vulnerability blocking
- ✅ Comprehensive reporting and visibility
- ✅ Integration with GitHub Security tab

## 🚀 PHASE 2 — CI/CD DEPLOYMENT

### Automated Build and Deployment Pipeline

#### Docker Image Management
- **Multi-service builds**: Each microservice built as separate Docker image
- **Version tagging**: Images tagged with Git SHA for traceability
- **Registry push**: Images pushed to GitHub Container Registry
- **Build caching**: Optimized build times with GitHub Actions cache

#### Kubernetes Deployment
- **Automated deployment**: Kubernetes manifests applied automatically
- **Rollout verification**: `kubectl rollout status` ensures successful deployment
- **Service health checks**: Automated verification of service availability

### CI/CD Features:
- ✅ Automated Docker builds for all services
- ✅ Container registry integration
- ✅ Kubernetes deployment automation
- ✅ Deployment verification and rollback capabilities

## 🛡️ PHASE 3 — RUNTIME SECURITY & BEST PRACTICES

### Kubernetes Security Hardening

#### Security Contexts
- **Non-root execution**: All containers run as non-root user (UID 1000)
- **Read-only filesystem**: Containers use read-only root filesystem
- **Privilege escalation prevention**: `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`
- **Capability dropping**: All unnecessary capabilities removed

#### Resource Management
- **Resource limits**: CPU and memory limits enforced
- **Resource requests**: Guaranteed resources for stable performance
- **Liveness probes**: Automatic container restart on failure
- **Readiness probes**: Traffic routing only to healthy containers

#### Network Security
- **Network policies**: Restrictive network access rules
- **Service isolation**: Internal service communication only
- **Ingress security**: Controlled external access via NGINX Ingress

#### Secrets Management
- **Kubernetes secrets**: Secure storage of sensitive data
- **Base64 encoding**: Proper encoding of secret values
- **Environment separation**: Different secrets per environment

### Security Files Created:
- `k8s/secrets.yaml` - Application secrets
- `k8s/pod-security-policy.yaml` - Pod security constraints
- `k8s/security-context-constraints.yaml` - Security context definitions
- `k8s/network-policy.yaml` - Network access policies

### Runtime Security Features:
- ✅ Non-root container execution
- ✅ Read-only filesystem enforcement
- ✅ Resource limits and requests
- ✅ Network policy enforcement
- ✅ Secure secrets management
- ✅ Health check automation

## 🏗️ PHASE 4 — INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE (Terraform)

### Infrastructure Management

#### Terraform Configuration: `infra/terraform/`

**Main Components:**
- **Namespace management**: Isolated Kubernetes namespace
- **ConfigMap creation**: Application configuration
- **Secrets management**: Secure sensitive data handling
- **ServiceAccount setup**: Application identity
- **RBAC configuration**: Role-based access control
- **Helm chart deployment**: RabbitMQ and NGINX Ingress
- **Network policies**: Security policy enforcement

#### Infrastructure Benefits:
- **Reproducibility**: Same infrastructure anywhere
- **Version control**: Infrastructure changes tracked in Git
- **Auditability**: Complete change history
- **Consistency**: Eliminates configuration drift
- **Collaboration**: Team review and approval process

### Terraform Files:
- `main.tf` - Main infrastructure configuration
- `variables.tf` - Configurable parameters
- `outputs.tf` - Deployment information
- `terraform.tfvars.example` - Example configuration
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### IaC Features:
- ✅ Infrastructure versioning
- ✅ Environment-specific configurations
- ✅ Automated resource provisioning
- ✅ State management and tracking
- ✅ Rollback capabilities

## 🔧 Configuration Requirements
